For my Final project for ECE 387 I chose to create internet connected lights. These are LED strip lights connected to a circuit board,
which is then connected to an arduino and an ethernet shield. One can control the color of the lights as well as the brightness all
through a webpage. This project also ulilizes a photoresistor to apply stable ambient lighting for a room.
